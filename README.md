## features/about
this is a reimplementation of LeCunn's 1998 paper "Gradient Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition" which introduced LeNet-5, a low-parameter CNN to classify handwritten digits 0-9.

hyperparameter values, loss choice, optimizer choice, initialization, architecture etc are all taken from the paper. My goal was to implement the paper as closely as possible and using as little of the pytorch library as I could (i.e. not using nn.conv2d, nn.avgpool, nn.BCE, nn.optim, etc)
